# Movie Recommendation System

This project involves building a movie recommendation system using data from the IMDB website. The dataset consists of two files: `movies.csv` containing information about movies, including their IDs, titles, and genres, and `ratings.csv` containing user ratings for these movies.

## Dataset Description

### movies.csv
- `movieId`: Movie identifier
- `title`: Movie title
- `genres`: Movie genres

### ratings.csv
- `userId`: User identifier
- `movieId`: Movie identifier for which the user gave a rating
- `rating`: User's rating for the movie
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of when the user rated the movie

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook explores and preprocesses the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

- **2. Recommendation System.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for building the movie recommendation system. It uses collaborative filtering and Content-Based recommendation system.

- **3. Results and Analysis.ipynb**: Analyze the results and provide insights into the recommendations generated by the system.

## Instructions for Running the Code

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Extract the provided zip file containing the required dataset files (`movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`) into the project directory.
4. Open recomender_system file (`*.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.


Feel free to reach out for any questions or clarifications.

**Note**: The dataset files (`movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`) are not included in this repository due to their size. Please make sure to add them to the project directory before running the code.
